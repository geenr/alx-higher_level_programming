0x0C. Python - Almost a circle
we are going to create several tests using the unittest method
NB all the names of the methods should start with the name test eg test_integer
basic syntax 
import unittest
class file_name(unittest.Testcase):
*args vs **kwargs
*args is used to send a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the function
**kwargs allows you to pass keyworded variable length of arguments to a function
