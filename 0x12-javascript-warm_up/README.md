JAVASCRIPT
it is almost similar to C language when it comes to commenting and being case sensitive
this langugage is used to modify a html website and make it more interactive
some datatypes include: 
Number - it is for normal integers
Bigint - for large size integers and it cant be used interchangeably with Number
Object - has a key - value arrangemebnt eg name: "kim"
strings - must be in either single or double quotes but mostly use single quotes

remember when using const to declare a variable you must initialize it but while using let it is not a must
in most cases it is preferred to use const instead of let but use const only if the variable value is not being reassigned
console.log() - is used in place of printf
semistandard - is the new betty of javascript
alert - is used instead of printf
